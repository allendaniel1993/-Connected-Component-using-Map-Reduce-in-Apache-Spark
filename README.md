# Connected-Component-using-Map-Reduce-in-Apache-Spark
Implemented an algorithm using large-star and small-star operations on a large undirected graph to find the connected component label for every vertex in the graph using Map-Reduce concepts. (Graph is too large to be represented in the memory of a single compute node)
